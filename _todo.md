Great
Now we need actual effects, like for need to show the clash, hit, etc.
Currently there is no such and tools are shown to fly past even though its recorded as hit.

Next we need to support dodging, like player can jumb, cruch, move left/right to avoid hit, etc. This should be a gameplay option on settings.

The available tools box is covering the interface, it should show up only before combat and hides...user can see it in help menu and there should be how to play guide too.

Add countdown before match starts.

We should have home screen with cards/buttons start game ( screen/modal:
 new game,  join (for multiplayer do nothing for now), resume), settings (top right), profile/account (top left), etc.


We should support camera control, lets say ctrl + arrow keys
